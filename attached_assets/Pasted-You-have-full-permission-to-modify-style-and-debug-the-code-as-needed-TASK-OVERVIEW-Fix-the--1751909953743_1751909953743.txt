üõ† TASK OVERVIEW:
Fix the dropdown menu structure and style in the header navigation of my site. Follow these exact specifications:

---

1. ‚úÖ REMOVE "nav." PREFIX:
- Only apply this in the **English version** of the site.
- Only inside the following dropdowns:
  - Services
  - Solutions
  - Products
- Keep other languages untouched.
- Remove the "nav." prefix from all submenu labels (e.g., `nav.services.aiConsulting` becomes `AI Consulting`).

---

2. üé® REDESIGN DROPDOWN STYLE (INSPIRED BY BINANCE.COM):
- Use a **modern, clean layout** like Binance:
  - Multi-column dropdown (2‚Äì3 columns depending on content)
  - Rounded corners (`8px`)
  - Soft shadow (`box-shadow`)
  - Padding inside dropdowns (`1.5rem`)
- Align dropdown under each top-level menu item.
- Animate dropdown appearance with fade/slide and hover effects.

---

3. üåô THEME SWITCH SUPPORT:
- Menu must visually switch between **dark and light modes** using existing theme toggler.
- Apply:
  - Light theme: white background, dark text (`#1a1a1a`)
  - Dark theme: dark background (`#111827`), light text (`#e5e7eb`)
  - Hover effects:
    - Light: blue hover text or soft gray background
    - Dark: light blue or gray hover text/background
- Use smooth transitions (`transition-colors duration-300`)

---

4. üåç LANGUAGE SWITCH SUPPORT:
- Ensure menu content updates dynamically with the language switcher.
- Translation keys must render the correct label in the selected language.
- Use clean, sentence-case labels in English (e.g., "AI Consulting").

---

5. üì± RESPONSIVE:
- On mobile: Collapse menu into a hamburger layout.
- Dropdowns should become accordion-style or drawer-based.
- Must support tap-to-open and close interactions.

---

6. ‚úÖ DEBUG & CLEANUP:
- If any issues arise (broken layout, missing translations, theme conflict), debug and fix them.
- Ensure everything works together: dropdown, theme switch, language switch, responsiveness.

---

üìå Final result must look clean, like Binance's dropdowns, and work across all themes and devices.

You have permission to rewrite any necessary CSS, HTML, logic files or configuration to meet these standards.

Proceed with the implementation and confirm when complete.
